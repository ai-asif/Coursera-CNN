# Coursera-CNN
Introductory Convolutional Neural Network for Solving Computer Vision Problems. The course assignments from Coursera course Convolutional Neural Network offered by DeepLearning.ai and Professor Andrew Ng.

The datasets used in these projects are hosted in HDFS.

This repository contains three projects on Convolutional Neural Network. The projects are implemented using Jupyter Notebook with Python3.

Projects are implemented using Keras on top of TensorFlow framework.

Three projects are:

1. Hand Sign Recognition
2. Happy Face Detection
3. Traffic Object Detection using YOLO algorithm
